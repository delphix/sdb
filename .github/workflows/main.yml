  # the "drgn" from source (there's no package currently available).
  #
  # Also note the following 2 things specific to mypy:
  # [1] We expicitly install version 0.730 as the default version that
  #     comes with Ubuntu is 0.75 which has a couple of bugs triggered
  #     by our codebase (they've been resolved on trunk though so we
  #     may want to change this soon).
  # [2] drgn doesn't provide a stubs file by default with all its type
  #     info leading to many complaints in mypy's side. Until this is
  #     fixed in drgn we skip any static type checking related to it.
