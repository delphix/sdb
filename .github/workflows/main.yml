  #
  # Also note the following 2 things specific to mypy:
  # [1] We expicitly install version 0.730 as the default version that
  #     comes with Ubuntu is 0.75 which has a couple of bugs triggered
  #     by our codebase (they've been resolved on trunk though so we
  #     may want to change this soon).
  # [2] We supply --ignore-missing-imports to the tests package because
  #     pytest doesn't provide stubs on typeshed.
