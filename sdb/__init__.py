Main SDB package module.

This is the high-level module of all the functionality
that is exposed by SDB. The API exposed in this module
can be used to implement commands for SDB and alternative
CLI/consumer implementations.

#
# We are being very explicit of what this module exposes
# so as to avoid any future cyclic-dependencies in how
# the modules are imported and attempt to have a cleaner
# separation of concerns between modules.
