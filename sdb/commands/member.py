    Dereference members of the given structure

    DESCRIPTION
        This is one of main commands used in SDB to explore members of C
        structures and traverse them hierarchically when these structures are
        nested. The notation used for this command is best demonstrated in the
        EXAMPLES section below but in general users should expect the notation
        used in standard C:
        [1] The dot notation/operator `.` can be used reference members in an
            embedded struct.
        [2] `->` can be used to walk into/dereference struct members that are
            pointers.
        [3] Array notation can be used to look into a specific element of an
            array using the index notation. This includes both formally
            specified arrays (like char[100]) and pointers that are used as
            arrays allocated at runtime.

        Something worth noting from a usability perspective for struct members
        that are pointers (see [2] above) is that SDB relaxes the notation and
        allows dereference with the `.` operator too. This means that something
        like this:
            `... | member ptr0->ptr1->ptr2`
        could be also written like this:
            `... | member ptr0.ptr1.ptr2`

    EXAMPLES
        Extract "active_mm" member from "task_struct" structure:

            sdb> addr init_task | member active_mm
            *(struct mm_struct *)0xffff9d0ac59198c0 = {
                    .mmap = (struct vm_area_struct *)0xffff9d0ac47179c0,
            ...

        Examine "active_mm" further by dereferencing its "hmm" member:

            sdb> addr init_task | member active_mm->hmm
            (struct hmm *)0x0

        Even if "active_mm" is a pointer the dot notation can be used in
        SDB and works the same as the previous example:

            sdb> addr init_task | member active_mm.hmm
            (struct hmm *)0x0

        There is no limit theoretically to how deep we can go examining
        nested structures:

            sdb> addr init_task | member active_mm.owner.vmacache
            (struct vmacache){
                    .seqnum = (u64)13,
                    .vmas = (struct vm_area_struct *[4]){
                        0x0, 0xffff9d0ac4717a90, 0xffff9d0ac46cb820,
                    },
            }

        The array notation can be used as in the following example where
        we examine the second element of the "vmas" array from the
        previous example:

            sdb> addr init_task | member active_mm.owner.vmacache.vmas[1]
            *(struct vm_area_struct *)0xffff9d0ac4717a90 = {
                    .vm_start = (unsigned long)140161947738112,
            ...

        Once the array notation has been used we can still continue to
        traverse hierachies (assuming the array elements are structures
        or further array dimensions) like in the example below:

            sdb> addr init_task | member active_mm.owner.vmacache.vmas[1].vm_end
            (unsigned long)93903319175168

        We can also print multiple structure fields with member by
        providing their names separated with spaces. For example below
        we print the "thread" and "mm" members of the "init_task"
        structure:

            sdb> addr init_task | member thread mm
            (struct thread_struct){
                    .tls_array = (struct desc_struct [3]){},
            ...
            (struct mm_struct *)0x0

        A member term is a sequence of member tokens grouped together that determine
        the next step of evaluation of the member expression. In this function terms
        are represented by tuples consisting of 2 elements. The first element specifies
        how can we access the subsequent express based on its type (PTR for '->', DOT
        for '.', ARRAY ..etc). The second element holds the name of the object that
        we are about to access (e.g. the name of the field that we are accessing with
        -> or the dot) or the index of element if we are accessing an array.

        The conventions when dereferencing structure members and array
        elements come straight from the standard C notation:
        [1] The dot notation/operator `.` can be used to reference

        [2] `->` can be used to walk/dereference struct members that
            are pointers.

        could be also written like this:
        `... | member ptr0.ptr1.ptr2`
        Besides saving one keystroke, this improves usability as users
        don't have to care about the exact type of the member being a
        struct or a pointer to a struct. This should also help users
        that are switching between DRGN and SDB during development and
        people coming from Acid.
