    Return address of the given object

    DESCRIPTION
        The command accepts input from both the pipe and the SDB CLI.

        For objects passed from the pipe, their address is returned
        only if they are legitimate objects created from the target
        program being examined. If the objects were created on the
        fly with something like echo and thus don't have an actual
        address in the address space of the program being examined,
        this command just passes on their values as pointers.

        The user can specify one or more inputs as arguments to the
        command. That input can be either the name of a symbol in
        the target (e.g. "jiffies" for vmlinux) or an address (at
        which point this command acts like `echo`).

    EXAMPLES
        Return address of the "jiffies" sumbol:

            sdb> addr jiffies
            *(volatile unsigned long *)0xffffffff97205000 = 4901248625

        Return address of "jiffies", "slab_caches", and also echo
        0xffffdeadbeef.

            sdb> addr jiffies slab_caches 0xffffdeadbeef
            *(volatile unsigned long *)0xffffffff97205000 = 4901290268
            *(struct list_head *)0xffffffff973014c0 = {

class Walk(Command):
    """
    Dispatch the appropriate walker based on the type of input

    DESCRIPTION
        This command can be used to walk data structures when
        a specific walker for them already exists. There are
        two scenarios when this command is preferable to using
        a specific walker:
        [1] When objects of different types are passed at once
            through a pipe, this walker can dispatch the
            appropriate walker for each of them so the user
            won't need to care about the underlying data
            structure implementations.
        [2] Commands that depend on a data structure being
            traversed can use this command, to reduce the
            lines of code changed when the underlying data
            structure chages.

        For a list of walkers, run 'walk' with no input.
