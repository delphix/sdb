# We depend on "drgn" for running our tests, and since there isn't any
# package for it already, we must build it from source.
#
# Also note, we don't use any specific version of the "drgn" source. In
# addition to it lacking packages, "drgn" also lacks any releases; thus,
# we just pull the HEAD of the master branch, and hope for the best.
